# Comparative Usage of Machine Learning

This project explores the comparative performance of three machine learning (ML) models, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, for their potential application as diagnostic tools for endometrial cancer (EC).

## Project Overview

The dataset underwent pre-processing including the removal of NA values, quantile normalization, and z-score standardization. Before wuamtile normalization, the dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 5-fold nested cross validation. Each ML model was trained on the training data and evaluated using the ROC curve and balanced accuracy metrics. The goal was to determine which model performed best in classifying EC cases.
